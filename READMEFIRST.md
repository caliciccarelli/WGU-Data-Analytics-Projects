DataCleaning206 is my data cleaning project. 
D207 is my data project where I created visualizations and created a T-Test. 
D208 (task 1) is a linear regression project. 
D208 (task 2) is a logistic regression project. 
Coming soon is D209 task 1 which uses the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to make predictions for the Churn Variable. 

The .ipynb files contain the runable code. The .docx files are the writing portion of the project. This includes an explanation and analysis of the code and output.
